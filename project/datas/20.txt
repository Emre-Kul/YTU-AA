The idea behind locality sensitive hashing is to take the document fingerprints and chop them up into pieces, each piece being some number of minhashes. Since a single minhash (single entry in the fingerprint) has a probability equal to the Jaccard similarity of producing a collision, each chopped up portion of the fingerprint should as well. This chopped up portion is the locality in locality sensitive hashing, the hashing can be any hash function which produces a bin ID from the fingerprint locality being hashed. Each bin holds the entire fingerprint of the document and that of other documents that hash to the same bin.
