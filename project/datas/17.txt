The main idea behind lsh is to take the document fingerprints and chop them up into pieces, each piece being some number of minhashes. Since a single minhash (single entry in the fingerprint) has a probability equal to the Jaccard similarity of producing a collision, each chopped up portion of the fingerprint should as well. This chopped up portion called as locality in locality sensitive hashing, the hashing is only a hash function (any hash function) that produces a bin ID from the fingerprint locality being hashed. Every bins hold the whole fingerprint (with a meta information) of the document and that of other documents that hash to the same bin.
