The idea behind locality sensitive hashing is to take the document fingerprints and chop them up into pieces, each piece being some number of minhashes. Because of a minhash (one entry in the fingerprint) has a probability equal to Jaccard simmilarity of producing a collision, all chopped up portion of the fingerprint should as well. This chopped up portion is the locality in locality sensitive hashing, the hashing is just a hash function (any hash function) which produces a bin ID from the fingerprint locality being hashed. Each bin holds the entire fingerprint (with optional meta information) of the document and that of other documents that hash to the same bin.
